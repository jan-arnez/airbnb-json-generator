# Airbnb URL to JSON generator

### How to use the generator
1. Fork the project

2. Install dependencies and run both projects
   
`cd backend`

`npm i`

`npm run dev`  

*Open a separate terminal and keep the first one running*

`cd frontend`

`npm i` 

`npm run dev`

**Airbnb URL to JSON should now be running. You can test it if you visit `http://localhost:5173/`**

### I want to change what is being scraped

**You can do that in the following file:**
`backend/src/scrapers/contentScraper.js`

**Why did you build this project? 
I had some spare time and I knew in the future that I want to do Airbnb clone but don't want to loose time adding data to seed the database so I created this.
